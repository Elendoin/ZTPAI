### 2. Regular User Login Test
- **URL**: http://localhost:5178/login
- **Credentials**: 
  - Email: test@example.com

### 3. Role Display Tests
- **Dashboard**: Should show user role with color coding
- **Users List**: Should show "ADMIN VIEW" badge for admins

- **Default Behavior**: Verify new users cannot delete others
